/**
 * Network-based automation: connect, switch profile or disconnect when the underlying network
 * changes. A Wi-Fi name (SSID) rule beats a Wi-Fi rule; Ethernet and mobile data rules match their
 * own networks.
 *
 * Only the service process evaluates rules. [NetworkAutomationService] watches whenever a connect
 * rule could act, and the running VPN or proxy service watches too. Both feed one [Tracker], so a
 * network is acted on once however many callbacks report it.
 *
 * User actions win over rules: a manual stop, or Android revoking the VPN, pauses connect rules until
 * the next manual start, and a manual start holds until the underlying network changes. Rules hold
 * back while Android reports another VPN.
